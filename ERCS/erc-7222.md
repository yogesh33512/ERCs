## Abstract

This EIP proposes a standard interface for count contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The standard defines basic functionalities for incrementing and retrieving counts, promoting interoperability between different implementations.

## Motivation

Count contracts are simple, yet widely used components in various decentralized applications. Having a standard interface will make it easier for developers to integrate and interact with different count contracts, fostering a more modular and interoperable Ethereum ecosystem.

## Specification

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface CountStandard {
    event CountIncreased(uint256 newCount);

    function increaseCount() external;
    function getCount() external view returns (uint256);
}

## Rationale

The proposed interface includes two functions: increaseCount to increment the count and getCount to retrieve the current count. An event CountIncreased is emitted when the count is increased.

### Interfaces

Standardizing an interface for provider information (`EIP6963ProviderInfo`) allows a DApp to determine all information necessary to populate a user-friendly wallet selection modal. This is particularly useful for DApps that rely on libraries such as Web3Modal, RainbowKit, Web3-Onboard, or ConnectKit to programmatically generate such selection modals.

Regarding the announced provider interface (`EIP6963ProviderDetail`), it was important to leave the [EIP-1193](./eip-1193.md) provider interface untouched for backwards compatibility; this allows conformant DApps to interface with wallets conforming to either, and for Wallets conformant to this spec to still inject [EIP-1193](./eip-1193.md) providers for legacy DApps. Note that a legacy dapp or a DApp conformant with this spec connecting to a legacy wallet cannot guarantee the correct wallet will be selected if multiple are present.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is backward compatible with contracts implementing the proposed interface.

## Test Cases

Test cases and sample implementations can be found in the tests directory.

## Security Considerations

The count contract should implement proper access controls to restrict who can modify the count.
Ensure gas optimizations to minimize transaction costs for count modifications.
